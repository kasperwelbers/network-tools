network-tools
=============

An R package with various functions to make network analysis more accessible for social scientific research.

Network analysis is a powerfull and increasingly popular method for social scientific research. However, many of the common sofware packages used in social sciences (e.g., SPSS, STATA) do not support it. Furthermore, while there are various software packages that facilitate the analysis and visualization of networks (e.g., Pajek, Gephi), there is little user-friendly support for creating network data. To do so, one is often has to resort to programming languages, which is an uncommon skill in the social sciences curriculum.

Luckily, there is R! As a leading statistical software package with a healthy dose of programming possibilities, R provides a platform for scholars less versed in programming to use cutting edge methods. The challenge that remains is to offer these methods in a way that is intuitive for social scientists. Many powerfull methods are readily available, but to promote the use of these methods, there is a need for liaisons.

In this package (in progress), we aim to make network analysis, and in particular the creation of network data, more accesible. To do so, we focus on three elements:
- Functions to create networks from data formats that are common in the social sciences.
- Functions to analyze and visualize networks for common social scientific research questions.
- Recognizable examples and tutorials.
